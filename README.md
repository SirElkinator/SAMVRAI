Game Synopsis

  Welcome to SamVRai, for centuries the Honifusho Valley has been a center for peaceful living and ... ...until rumors about the serpent cult invading the sacred dojo were confirmed with many going missing not to return. You have been selected as the next samurai to try and get to the bottom of these disappearances, as you approach the dojo a sense of dread fills your heart. Everything still seems to be as normal, but something feels off. As you enter the front doors of the dojo you notice two katanas on the ground...

About the Game
	
   Samurai VR, henceforth known as SamVRai, is a virtual reality game for the HTC VIVE developed in Unity version 2018.2.12f1 by Jacksonville State University students Chase Sparks, Paul Zachos, Dalton Murphree, Adam Newton and Joshua Luce. Originally planned as a controller-based sword fighting game, the group eventually decided it could easily be developed into a VR game. The objectives are relatively simple: Avoid the flying projectiles by deflecting them with swords attached to the two VIVE controllers. To score points, hit them back at the enemies that threw them.
	The terrain and different natural map features were designed in Unity’s various elements. The code was written in C#. The Dojo itself and several objects in the game including the enemies, were designed in the program Blender and are saved as .blend files. While most of the game was created completely from scratch, a few things were borrowed from online sources such as object textures, audio files and the VR API called VRTK. These have all been sourced back to the original files in the “Credits” section.
	On February 15th, 2019 the development team presented SamVRai to a panel of judges and JSU Faculty as well as many audience members. The game obtained overall good reception and had two viewers come forth to test it. This is documented on YouTube under the profile JSU Student Symposium.
